With a background in computer science and a strong interest in human-centered AI, I hope to contribute to building a more just and inclusive world. Iâ€™m especially driven to support underrepresented communities by developing tools and systems that amplify their voices and address real societal challenges.

You can find bolgs and CV on this website. Hope you can like them :relaxed:
