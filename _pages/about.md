I am a thesis-based master's student in the Human-Centered Computing Group at Western University. My research interest lies in Human-Centered AI, AI fairness, and Computational Social Science. I am passionate about leveraging my technical background to conduct research that drives meaningful social impact. My work focuses on understanding and improving the ways AI systems interact with people. Currently, I am exploring how large language models (LLMs) influence human opinions and beliefs, with the goal of informing safer, more ethical AI design.
